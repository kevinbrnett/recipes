    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Who knew a mystery meat from a can could be so elegant? The spam musubi <em>quite literally</em> wraps
            comfort with decadence, in this salty, sweet, and rich dish. Forget <strong>GROSS</strong> egg finger sandwiches.
            The spam musubi is the only finger food you will need for the rest of your life.</p>
